Week 2 - You can pick your data set, but please either include it with your submission or provide a URL where we can download it. There are several sets built into R/R packages (such as iris or mtcars), but it might be more interesting for you to find a dataset online that is of personal interest to you.

Create a simplified version of this regression on just one explanatory variable (pick one that had some predictive significance) but make a polynomial fit out of it. Try adding several polynomial terms.

Bonus: try exploring ridge regression in R. We did not go over this in class, but it's good to learn how to deal with new functions and packages as you'll certainly have to do this in a data job. Look up lm.ridge. Try fitting the same regression with ordinary linear regression and ridge regression and compare some of the predictions and coefficients.
